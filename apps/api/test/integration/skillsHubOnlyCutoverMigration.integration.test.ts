/**
 * Product promise:
 * The Skills Hub-only cutover never loses the sole database references to historical runtime
 * objects before the old release has deleted those objects from external providers.
 *
 * Regression caught:
 * A direct DROP of runtime tables would make S3 keys and sandbox/checkpoint identities unreachable,
 * retaining sensitive objects and billable provider resources indefinitely.
 *
 * Why integrated:
 * This is an upgrade-only guarantee. It depends on replaying the real migration history through
 * 0062, seeding an old durable ownership row, and executing the exact 0063 PostgreSQL guard.
 *
 * Failure proof:
 * Removing or moving the guard after the first DROP lets the populated migration succeed or lose
 * the seeded ownership row.
