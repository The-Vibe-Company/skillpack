It is never sold, rented, shared, transferred, or disclosed to any third party other than Google. It is never used to train machine learning models, never used for advertising, and never combined with other data. The only copy of Gmail content that exists outside Google is inside your private Skillpack conversation transcript, which is visible only to you and workspace members you explicitly invite, and is never shared.",

All data access is scoped by organization with forced row-level security and least-privilege database roles. All transport uses TLS. You can revoke access at any time by disconnecting the Gmail integration in Skillpack settings or via your Google Account permissions page — revocation deletes stored credentials immediately.",

Disconnecting the integration — or revoking access from your Google Account permissions page — deletes stored credentials from our systems immediately and permanently. Gmail content referenced in a conversation transcript is retained only as long as your Skillpack conversation exists, and is permanently deleted when you delete the companion or the conversation. Deleting your account deletes all associated data, including stored credentials and transcripts.",

              We design Skillpack to keep your workspace under your control. We collect and use
              information needed to provide the Skills Hub, authenticate members,
              and keep the service secure. This policy focuses on the Gmail integration and its data
              practices; your organization may also host its own Skillpack deployment and set additional
              rules for its workspace.
