 * The CAPABILITY gate (the "can the actor DO it?" half of authorization). The
 * VISIBILITY gate ("can the actor SEE it?") is enforced separately by Postgres RLS.
 * Both must pass. This module is framework-free and shared by the web routes and CLI.
 *
 * ORG skills are FLAT: every org skill is visible to every member, and any member may do anything to
 * it (read / create / update / delete / publish / label-*). PERSONAL skills are private: only the
 * creator (the owner) can see or modify them — admins included. {@link canAccessSkill} /
 * {@link canManagePersonalSkill} express that per-resource gate; the flat capability gate
 * ({@link canPerform}) still governs the action itself. Org governance (member/role management)
 * mirrors the SQL guards in the SECURITY DEFINER management RPCs — the database is authoritative;
 * these power the route layer + the table-driven tests. Every role passed in is the actor's role IN
 * A SPECIFIC org, so a role in org A never authorizes org B.
 *
 * Public share-link previews are not routed through `canAccessSkill`: they are a separate,
 * explicit metadata-only read path that resolves only live org skills by unguessable token.
