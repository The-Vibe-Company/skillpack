/**
 * Product promise:
 * Guided onboarding always resumes at the first unconfirmed step and completes only after all three.
 *
 * Regression caught:
 * Reordering or weakening the completion predicate could skip a review or falsely hide the checklist.
 *
 * Why this test is unit-level:
 * Step ordering and completion are pure rules; transaction and RLS behavior belong to integration.
 *
 * Failure proof:
 * Returning a later missing step or allowing any null timestamp to count as complete fails the matrix.
