-- Companion reconciler bookkeeping. Every recovery mechanism so far runs inside one API request or
-- one open browser tab; a Companion nobody is looking at stays broken exactly as it is. The worker
-- gains a reconciliation loop, and this migration gives it the two things the loop needs: a lease
-- row per Companion (so concurrent workers cannot double-treat one) and a pair of SECURITY DEFINER
-- functions — candidate claim and lease settlement — that are its only path to that table.
--
-- Leases deliberately live beside `companions`, not on it: `companions.updated_at` is the CAS token
-- every lifecycle finalizer compares against, and reconciler bookkeeping must never move it.

/*
 * Claim up to p_limit Companions that need reconciler attention, most urgent first. Cross-tenant by
 * design — the definer bypasses RLS the way the other worker claim functions do — and returned rows
 * carry the owner's identity so the worker can run every subsequent org-scoped service under that
 * owner's tenant context.
 *
 * Reasons, in priority order, each with a grace window so an active client or a live request wins:
 *   stale_start     — a `provisioning` claim whose owner went quiet past the takeover window
 *   archive_resume  — the durable `stopping`/`starting` marker with no open tab continuing it
 *   deletion_stuck  — the Owner-deletion lock (`stopping`/`unknown`) that a failed Box stop stranded
 *   redelivery      — a recent, undelivered user tail on a Companion no client is actively syncing
 *   liveness        — a `running` projection nothing has observed lately (bounded to recent starts)
 *   expiry_sweep    — overdue tool chips or expired permission cards on an unread thread
 *
 * A row is claimable only when its lease is free and its backoff gate (`next_attention_at`) has
 * passed; the conditional upsert is what makes two workers ticking together claim disjoint sets.
