# Skillpack workspace API — quick reference

Base URL is `COMPANION_API_URL` (ends in `/v1`). The active workspace id is
`COMPANION_WORKSPACE_ID` (`organizations.id`). Agent Auth is the default management identity. The
bundled `scripts/skillpack-agent-client.mjs` discovers the instance, uses delegated device approval,
and signs one 60-second request-bound JWT at a time. Its closed operation registry maps only the
documented REST operations to `skills:read`, `skills:write`, `secrets:read`, `secrets:write`,
`database:read`, or `database:write`, each
constrained to the exact workspace id. `database:write` includes `database:read` because DML can observe
state through predicates, subqueries, conflict handling, and returned rows. The public install flow uses the instance-wide
`public-skills:install` capability.

When `COMPANION_DELEGATION_TOKEN` is present, the client requires `COMPANION_API_URL` and
`COMPANION_WORKSPACE_ID`, skips `credentials.json` and every connect/device-flow path, and uses the
opaque child PAT on PAT-enabled routes. If `COMPANION_DELEGATION_TARGET_ID` is set, every bearer
request includes the matching target header. This explicit id binding is not Conductor attestation;
possession of both values remains sufficient until expiry or revocation.

Resolve those values from the environment first. If either variable is missing, read the dedicated
local credentials file written by the Skillpack install/use prompt:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.companion/credentials.json`
- Windows: `$HOME\.companion\credentials.json`

The current file is schema v3, keyed by workspace id, and contains only a non-secret Agent Auth
reference:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 3,
  "activeWorkspaceId": "6a9c3cfd-6a1e-4a7b-8f77-1f7f0e62e3d4",
  "workspaces": {
    "6a9c3cfd-6a1e-4a7b-8f77-1f7f0e62e3d4": {
      "apiUrl": "https://skillpack.app/v1",
      "agentAuth": {
        "issuer": "https://skillpack.app/auth",
        "agentId": "agent_01J..."
      },
      "updatedAt": "2026-06-15T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Use `activeWorkspaceId` to pick the workspace entry. Agent and host private keys are generated
automatically and stored outside this file under `~/.companion/agent-auth/` in `0600` files inside
`0700` directories. They never enter argv, stdout, packages, audit events, or logs.

Schema v2 and legacy flat PATs are preserved as `legacyPat` during migration. They are used only when
the user explicitly sets `COMPANION_AUTH_MODE=legacy-pat`; an Agent Auth failure never falls back to
them. The legacy refresh endpoint retains its existing behavior only in that explicit mode.

The official client takes one JSON request on stdin and returns one value-free JSON envelope on
stdout:

```sh
printf '%s' '{"action":"connect","apiUrl":"https://skillpack.app/v1","workspaceId":"6a9c3cfd-6a1e-4a7b-8f77-1f7f0e62e3d4","name":"Codex"}' \
  | node scripts/skillpack-agent-client.mjs

printf '%s' '{"action":"api","method":"GET","path":"/skills?lib=org"}' \
  | node scripts/skillpack-agent-client.mjs
```

Use `action: "connect"` once when the workspace has no Agent Auth reference. It performs discovery,
dynamic host registration, and the device-approval flow, writes value-free status events to stderr,
and persists the resulting non-secret workspace reference. Rerun the requested API action after
approval.

Use `action: "delegate"` only with an existing local Agent Auth identity and an inherited owner-only
FIFO descriptor `outputFd >= 3`. Sockets and regular files are refused. Optional `ttlSeconds` is bounded to seven days and
`targetWorkspaceId` records the intended runtime target. The action uses an already-active
workspace-bound `skills:read` grant without approval, calls `POST /tokens` with
`inherit_agent_grants:true`, writes the returned plaintext only to the descriptor, and prints only
metadata. It never stores the child PAT or copies an Agent Auth private key.

Uploads use `action: "upload"` plus `inputPath` and an exact query containing
`action=publish|validate`, `expect_slug`, and `version`; existing skills also require
`expect_skill_id`. Downloads use `action: "download"` plus `outputPath`. Neither a PAT, JWT,
transfer ticket, nor secret value belongs in argv. Secret redemption is the one special transport:
the Python runtime invokes `action: "secret-redeem"` with an inherited owner-only FIFO descriptor
of 3 or greater. The client refuses stdout, stderr, sockets, and regular files, writes the redeemed JSON only
to that pipe, and leaves only item counts on stdout. Do not invoke the grant or redeem endpoints via
the generic `api` action. These are the
closed Skillpack Agent Auth operations; the same routes remain compatible with an explicitly chosen
legacy PAT:

## Skill Databases

Both statement routes accept:

```json
{
  "audience": "personal",
  "realm_id": "3da39fa7-a8a4-4d91-a5fc-b09baf73447d",
  "sql": "SELECT ticket_id, processed_at FROM processed_tickets WHERE ticket_id = ? LIMIT 1",
  "params": ["LIN-42"]
}
```

`audience` defaults to `organization`; use `personal` for the caller's private realm. Optional
`realm_id` is valid only for `personal` and selects an explicitly shared realm returned by the
description endpoint. Without it, personal requests remain scoped to the caller. Each described
realm includes `id`, `owner`, and access `organization`, `owner`, or `shared`. A response
contains `columns`, array-shaped `rows`, `row_count`, `changes`, `last_insert_rowid`, `read_only`,
`db_size_bytes`, and `schema_generation`. Large integers outside JavaScript's safe range are strings;
BLOBs are base64; `json` and `timestamp` columns remain text.

The query route permits `SELECT`, `VALUES`, and read-only `WITH`. Execute additionally permits
`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. Use `?` placeholders: DDL, PRAGMA, ATTACH, VACUUM, multiple
statements, and non-terminal semicolons are forbidden. Defaults: 16 MiB per realm, 2-second timeout,
1,000 rows, 1 MiB result bytes, 8,192 SQL characters, 64 parameters, 64 KiB parameter JSON, and 120
requests/minute/member/workspace. Manifest string defaults are limited to 4 KiB, non-null columns
without defaults cannot be retired, every primary-key column must be non-nullable, non-null columns
cannot declare null defaults, and generated table definitions are limited to 8 KiB. Limits return
explicit errors rather than truncated results. `INSERT` must use an explicit column list containing
only active declared columns; implicit physical-column order and retired columns are forbidden.

Error codes and statuses: `forbidden_statement` 403; `timeout` 408; `database_full` and
`result_too_large` 413; `skill_not_found`, `skill_database_not_declared`, and
`skill_database_no_realm` and `skill_database_disabled` 404; `skill_database_invalid_share` and
`sql_error` 400; `skill_database_archived`,
`skill_database_sharing_unavailable`, and `conflict` 409; `skill_database_rate_limited` 429;
`overloaded` and `storage_unavailable` 503.

## Guided onboarding

`GET /getting-started` returns the current member's state in the active workspace:

```json
{
  "companion_installed_at": "2026-07-28T12:00:00.000Z",
  "local_reviewed_at": null,
  "org_reviewed_at": null,
  "completed_at": null,
  "dismissed_at": null,
  "completed": false,
  "first_incomplete_step": "local_review"
}
```

Resume from `first_incomplete_step`. Record a review only after every item was resolved, where a
decline and an empty result are both valid resolutions:

```http
POST /getting-started/steps
Content-Type: application/json

{ "step": "local_review", "agent": "Codex" }
```

The allowed steps are `companion_install`, `local_review`, and `org_review`. Step timestamps and
`completed_at` are first-write-wins; retrying a successful request is safe. Treat progress as
recorded only after a 2xx response. A 404 means the instance does not support guided onboarding, so
continue normal Skillpack use. Dismiss and reopen are intentionally browser-session-only; an agent
must not call them.

## Secret bindings and retrieval

`companion.json.environment.secrets[ENV_KEY].slotId` is an optional UUID on input and always stable
after normalization. Preserve an existing `slotId` when renaming its environment key. Requirements
returned by skill endpoints expose the same identity as `slot_id`; ordinary `environment.env`
variables do not use the vault.

Delegated Agent Auth has the same Secrets-management capabilities as its approving user inside the
constrained workspace.
Prefer the bundled helper so a new value never enters argv or output and can be bound to a declared
skill slot in the same workflow:

```sh
python3 scripts/create_secret.py --name "Production API key" --key SERVICE_API_KEY
printf '%s' "$SECRET_VALUE" | python3 scripts/create_secret.py \
  --name "Production API key" --key SERVICE_API_KEY --audience organization --value-stdin --json
python3 scripts/create_secret.py \
  --name "Production API key" --key SERVICE_API_KEY --audience organization --skill deploy-service
```

The helper calls:

```http
POST /secrets
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Production API key",
  "key": "SERVICE_API_KEY",
  "value": "<write-only value>",
  "audience": "personal | restricted | organization",
  "recipient_ids": []
}
```

The `201` response is metadata-only and never contains `value`. For `restricted`, pass one or more
recipient user ids with repeated `--recipient`; the server rejects non-members. Always confirm the
audience and recipients with the user before creation. The first write requests `secrets:write`
through device approval; values still travel only through the helper's private prompt or stdin.

With `--skill`, the helper first calls `GET /skills/{slug}/secret-configuration`, resolves the unique
slot whose `env_key` matches `--key`, then calls `PUT /skills/{slug}/secret-bindings/{slotId}` with the
new metadata-only `secret_id`. Slot validation happens before the helper reads the secret value.

The same delegated agent may perform every other vault and binding mutation with `secrets:write`:

- `PATCH/DELETE /secrets/{id}`, `POST /secrets/{id}/rotate`;
- `PUT/DELETE /skills/{slug}/secret-bindings/{slotId}`;
- `PUT/DELETE /skills/{slug}/secret-suggestions/{slotId}` and
  `POST /skills/{slug}/secret-suggestions/{slotId}/accept`.

These routes still enforce the grant's exact workspace, current membership, the user's ownership or
audience access, the target skill's visibility, and stable slot existence. Agent Auth and explicit
legacy PAT mode never gain cross-workspace or another owner's secret access.

Retrieval uses `secrets:read`. Start an install/sync with a metadata-only preflight:

```http
POST /secret-retrievals/preflight
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "operation_id": "5e90cf51-d5c9-47a9-bf23-a78bf717c649",
  "skills": [{ "slug": "incident-summary", "version": "1.4.0" }],
  "direct": []
}
```

The response contains `plan_id`, five-minute `expires_at`, the exact root/dependency versions and
slot statuses, opaque tombstones, and `blockers`/`warnings`. It never contains a value. A required
missing slot blocks before local mutation; an optional missing slot only warns.

After one global user confirmation, explicit legacy PAT mode performs the two HTTP exchanges below.
Agent Auth instead calls `api_redeem_secret_plan`, which performs the same exchange inside the
bundled client and returns plaintext only through its inherited owner-only FIFO:

```http
POST /secret-retrievals/{planId}/grant
{}

POST /secret-grants/redeem
{ "grant": "cmp_grant_…" }
```

The grant expires after 60 seconds, is stored server-side only as a hash, and is consumed once. The
server rechecks membership, ACL, revocation, and the planned exact version during preflight, grant,
and redemption. Keep the redemption response in memory and write only the final private `.env`;
never put a value or grant in stdout, argv, logs, errors, analytics, packages, credentials,
manifests, or lockfiles.
Rotation after preflight preserves the planned version. Any access loss invalidates the entire
redemption and requires a new preflight.

For a manual profile, send no skills and one `direct` item:

```json
{
  "operation_id": "5e90cf51-d5c9-47a9-bf23-a78bf717c649",
  "skills": [],
  "direct": [{
    "secret_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000100",
    "env_key": "SERVICE_TOKEN",
    "profile": "operations"
  }]
}
```

The bundled scripts project skill values under
`~/.companion/secrets/<workspace>/<skill>/.env` and manual values under
`~/.companion/secrets/<workspace>/_manual/<profile>/.env` with `0700` directories, `0600` files,
same-filesystem staging, exclusive locks, symlink/traversal refusal, and rollback markers.

Public org-skill previews are separate from authenticated management. Use the `share_token`
returned on skill rows to build the web URL `/s/{share_token}` or to fetch metadata directly:

```http
GET /public/skills/{share_token}
```

This endpoint is anonymous. It returns only `display_name`, `slug`, `description`,
`current_version`, `creator_name`, `creator_initials`, `updated_at`, and
`public_release: { version, checksum, size_bytes, released_at } | null` for a live org skill. The
preview exists even when `public_release` is null. When it is non-null, `/s/{share_token}` and its
Open Graph image use that pinned release rather than a newer internal version. Personal, archived,
and unknown tokens return 404. It never exposes package content, files, requirements, secrets,
labels, `id`, `org_id`, or `creator_id`.

Authenticated skill rows also include `public_version` and `can_manage_public`. Only the creator or a
workspace Owner/Admin may manage the pointer. The skill must be org-scoped, and only its current
version may be promoted:

```http
PUT /skills/{slug}/public-version
Content-Type: application/json

{ "version": "1.4.0" }
```

A concurrent new publish makes the selected version stale and returns `409`. Re-read and ask again.
Never republish the archive when only promotion failed. `DELETE /skills/{slug}/public-version` is
idempotent. It preserves the share token; archive also preserves the pointer while making both page
and package return 404.

The exact pinned archive is downloaded from:

```http
GET /public/skills/{share_token}/versions/{version}/package
X-Companion-Transfer-Ticket: cmp_xfer_...
```

The route accepts a verified Better Auth browser session, a 60-second one-use Agent Auth transfer
ticket, or a PAT carrying `public-skills:install`. It rejects anonymous and under-scoped PAT requests.
`public-skills:install` is instance-wide but its
execution accepts only a known public token/version, then binds the hashed ticket to the approving
user, agent, action, workspace, version, checksum, and size. Consumption revalidates all current
state. The ticket never belongs in a URL, argv, output, or log.

A public install handles only this ZIP root: verify checksum and size; reject traversal, absolute
paths, backslashes, symlinks/hard links, special files, NTFS alternate-data-stream syntax, DOS
device names, trailing-dot/space aliases, and portable case-folding collisions; require `SKILL.md` at the package root;
ask global or project before writing; reject symlinks in the selected install root and each
package-controlled destination ancestor; verify the physical library stays contained by that root
before staging and replacement; confirm replacement; then swap atomically. Never execute scripts,
follow dependencies, resolve Secrets, or create `skill_installs`.

The successful client result reports `prerequisites.dependencies`, `required_env`, `optional_env`,
`required_secrets`, and `optional_secrets` as warnings only. It normalizes both the current
`companion.json` dependency/environment maps and supported legacy dependency/requirement arrays with
the same defaults as package validation. Only when `companion.json` is absent does it fall back to
validated `SKILL.md` frontmatter requirements; a present manifest always wins.

The compiled client accepts the confirmed installation as one JSON stdin request (never put the
ticket or a credential in this JSON):

```json
{"action":"public-install","token":"<share-token>","version":"<public-version>","checksum":"sha256:<digest>","sizeBytes":1234,"tool":"claude-code","scope":"global","confirmInstall":true,"confirmReplace":false}
```

For `scope: "project"`, include the absolute `projectRoot`. `confirmReplace` may be true only after
the user has separately approved replacing the resolved existing folder.

The signed-in web app uses `GET /skills/share-target/{share_token}` with a session cookie to resolve
`{org_id, slug}` for members before opening the slug-keyed detail route. Agents should normally share
the web URL `/s/{share_token}` instead of calling that resolver directly.

Before naming and filing a brand-new skill, call the `skills:read` workspace policy endpoint:

```http
GET /v1/orgs/current/skill-naming-policy
```

From `COMPANION_API_URL` (which already ends in `/v1`), call
`GET /orgs/current/skill-naming-policy`. The response is `{ "policy": string | null }`. If `policy`
is a string, apply it to the skill slug, package name, and folder choices. If it is `null`, do not
impose a naming or filing convention.

After a successful skill upload or update, agents must include a `Skill link: ...` line in the chat.
For org skills, fetch `GET /skills?lib=org`, find the published `slug`, and build
`${COMPANION_API_URL without /v1}/s/{share_token}` from that row. Personal skills have no public
preview until they are shared to the org; use the signed-in detail URL
`${COMPANION_API_URL without /v1}/skills?skill={slug}` instead. If the publish succeeded but the
org `share_token` lookup fails, do not republish; report success and provide the signed-in detail
fallback.

Some skills-management routes are intended for the signed-in web session rather than Agent Auth or a
legacy PAT. Use them only when the caller is operating with a valid session cookie:

| Action | Method & path | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolve a share link target | `GET /skills/share-target/{share_token}` | Session |
| Enumerate versions | `GET /skills/{slug}/versions` | Session |
| Read comments | `GET /skills/{slug}/comments` | Session |
| Add a comment | `POST /skills/{slug}/comments` | Session |
| Deprecate/restore a comment | `PATCH /skills/{slug}/comments/{id}` | Session |
| Read a comment image | `GET /skills/{slug}/comments/{commentId}/images/{imageId}` | Session |

Version rows returned by `GET /skills/{slug}/versions` include a nullable `changelog` object. When
present, it is the `companion.json.metadata.changelog` entry for that exact version and carries
`version`, optional `date`, and `changes`.

`GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/files` returns package-relative paths, sizes, capped text
content, and preview metadata. Use `GET /skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/files/content?path={path}`
only for browser-native previews of text, JSON, Markdown, images, SVG, and PDF. Unsupported files
return 415 and should be downloaded through the package endpoint instead.

A comment row includes an `images` array; each image carries `id`, `content_type`, `byte_size`,
`position`, and a `url` (the session-gated path above) for display. To attach images when adding a
comment, send `POST /skills/{slug}/comments` as `multipart/form-data` with the `body` field plus up to
six `image` files (PNG, JPEG, WebP, or GIF, 10 MB each); the content type is verified from the file
bytes. Text-only comments may still be sent as JSON.

Skill metadata rows returned by `GET /skills` and `GET /skills/{slug}` include both `description`
(the short summary used in lists and detail leads) and `notes` (optional Markdown-compatible
`companion.json` notes), plus `icon`, the current manifest's portable catalog icon or `null` for older
packages. Rows also include `share_token`, which is only for org-skill public preview
links and is not an auth credential. Rows include creator provenance (`creator_id`, `creator_name`,
`creator_initials`, `creator_avatar_url`) plus `modifiers`: distinct members who published versions
after the creator, ordered by latest publish time, each as `{ user_id, name, initials, avatar_url }`.
Keep summaries and notes distinct: do not copy setup notes or long Markdown content into
`description`.

Manifest v2 accepts an optional root `icon`. Valid values are `activity`, `bookmark`, `bot`, `box`,
`boxes`, `braces`, `building-2`, `calendar`, `clock`, `code`, `cpu`, `file`, `file-code`, `file-text`,
`flame`, `globe`, `hash`, `heart`, `image`, `key`, `layers`, `mail`, `megaphone`, `message-square`,
`monitor`, `package`, `palette`, `pen-tool`, `plug-zap`, `rocket`, `shield`, `sparkles`,
`square-stack`, `star`, `tag`, `terminal`, `users`, and `zap`. Preserve the field when normalizing,
repairing, or republishing a manifest. Unknown values fail validation; omission remains compatible.

Do not use this skill for workspace members, invitations, Skillpack Owner/Editor/Viewer sharing,
Skillpack transcripts or runtime actions, org settings mutation, or general token management. Those
Skillpack routes require a signed-in browser session and are intentionally absent from the delegated
Agent Auth registry. The automatic current-token refresh above is the only token-management exception.
The only org-settings surface in the closed Skillpack capability registry is
`GET /orgs/current/skill-naming-policy` (`skills:read`; also available in explicit legacy PAT mode).

Listing the workspace catalog (`GET /skills?lib=org`), My Skills (`GET /skills?lib=mine`), and
Skillpack-reported installs (`GET /skills?installed=true`) work with Agent Auth `skills:read` or an
explicit legacy PAT carrying that scope.
`installed=true` means the current user has a `skill_installs` row in Skillpack; it does not prove
the package files still exist on disk. To inventory what is actually installed on this machine, read
the active workspace-id entry in `~/.companion/skills.lock.json` first, then fall back to pointed-at
skill folders with `companion.json.metadata.companionSkillId` / `companion.json.version`.
`~/.companion/skills.log.json` is a legacy alias: read it only once if `skills.lock.json` is absent,
then write future state to `skills.lock.json`.

The built-in Skillpack skill is different from user-published skills. For the skill shown in the
workspace's **Skillpack skills** section, use only the `/local-skills/skillpack` endpoints.
The `GET /local-skills/skillpack` response includes `workspaceId`; use it as
`COMPANION_WORKSPACE_ID` when migrating legacy flat credentials or URL-keyed lockfiles.

## Libraries (personal vs org)

A skill lives in one of two libraries, set by its `scope`:

- **`org`** — the flat org-wide library: visible to every member, and any member can read, edit,
  archive, or delete it. Organized with org-wide **labels** (folders).
- **`personal`** — a private "My Skills" library: visible only to its creator (even to admins).
  Organized with the creator's own **personal folders** (`/personal-labels`).

`GET /skills?lib=mine` returns the caller's My Skills (their authored personal skills plus org skills
they have installed); `GET /skills?lib=org` (the default) returns the org library;
`GET /skills?lib=accessible` returns everything the caller may reference — every org skill plus
their own personal skills — in one list. On first publish,
the `scope` field chooses the library. The Skillpack skill must send `scope=personal` or `scope=org`
explicitly for a brand-new skill after asking the user where to publish it; do not rely on server
defaults. Re-publishing never changes scope, so do not send `scope` on updates. Depending on server
version, update-time `scope` may be ignored or rejected if it contradicts the existing skill.
**`GET /skills/{slug}/share-plan`** previews the mandatory private dependency migration for a personal
skill. It returns the private dependencies owned by the same creator that will be shared with the root
skill, plus any blocking dependency issues. **`POST /skills/{slug}/share`** is the only way to move a
personal skill into the org library (owner only, one-way). Sharing is atomic and includes those private
dependencies automatically; the response includes `shared_dependencies`. A skill name (slug) is unique
across both libraries in a workspace.

## Free and Pro entitlements

Self-hosted workspaces are fully unlocked. Managed SaaS Free workspaces apply the same gates to
session, Agent Auth, and explicit legacy PAT skill operations. Billing endpoints are intentionally
session-only and are not part of the closed Agent Auth or legacy PAT surface.

An entitlement refusal is HTTP `403` with this shape:

```json
{
  "code": "org_skill_limit_reached",
  "feature": "org_skill_create",
  "message": "Free includes up to 20 organization skills. Upgrade to create another.",
  "effectivePlan": "free",
  "limit": 20,
  "current": 20,
  "upgradeUrl": "/settings?view=billing"
}
```

Codes are `upgrade_required`, `org_skill_limit_reached`, and `catalog_frozen`. Free returns only
installed org skills from `lib=mine`, locks personal skills/folders/Share, counts active and archived
org skills toward the 20-skill limit, and exposes only the current version. At exactly 20, updating an
existing org skill is still allowed. Above 20, publish, rename, restore, and Share are frozen, while
read, install, download, and archive remain available. Older version package/file requests return
`upgrade_required` with `feature: "skill_history"`.

Treat these responses as final product gates: do not retry, switch scope, or probe hidden personal
resources. Surface the message and direct a signed-in Owner/Admin to `upgradeUrl`.

## Upload bodies and labels

`POST /skills` accepts either:

- `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field (and `version` / `message` / `expect_slug` /
  `expect_skill_id` / `scope` / `dependency` / `label` fields), or
- a raw `application/zip` or `application/gzip` body (the archive itself), with the same options as
  query params.

Declare dependencies in the package root `companion.json`. Manifest v2 uses a name-to-id map:
`{ "dependencies": { "markdown-report": "84d8bee1-5ad3-4676-8c16-730e2a15ba70" } }`.
The API still accepts repeated `dependency=<slug>` parameters as a legacy fallback only when the
uploaded archive has no `companion.json`; when the manifest exists, its dependency keys win. The
Skillpack skill must analyze the local package, compare the result with `companion.json`, ask before
changing the dependency map, resolve each dependency to its workspace skill id, synchronize
`companion.json`, and only then package and send the archive. Set `action=validate` to run every
package and identity check without publishing; the validate response is
`{ "result": <validation>, "dependency_plan": <plan> }`.

After a successful publish or re-publish performed by the Skillpack skill, an org skill must be
reported as installed for the current user:

```http
POST /skills/{slug}/install
Content-Type: application/json

{ "version": "1.10.0", "source": "agent", "agent": "Claude Code" }
```

Skip this install report for personal skills; they already appear in the author's My Skills library.
If the install report fails after publish succeeds, do not republish. Tell the user publish succeeded
and retry only the install report.

The install report stays **aggregate**: the workspace tracks one `skill_installs` row per user, with
no per-tool dimension. When a skill is installed into several local tools at once (Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode, Grok Bot, OpenClaw, Hermes, …) or into multiple projects, still send a **single**
`POST /skills/{slug}/install`, using `agent` to name the tools (for example
`"Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Grok Bot, OpenClaw, Hermes"`). Grok Bot is Cursor's desktop assistant,
so it targets Cursor's supported `~/.cursor/skills` user-global root and `<project>/.cursor/skills`
project root. OpenClaw targets
`~/.openclaw/skills` for user-global installs and `<workspace>/skills` for workspace installs. Hermes targets only its recursive,
user-global source of truth at `~/.hermes/skills`. The per-tool, per-project install locations
are tracked locally, not in the workspace: each lockfile skill record carries a `targets[]` array
(`{ tool, scope, path, checksum }`), user-scope targets in `~/.companion/skills.lock.json` and
project-scope targets in a per-project `<repo>/.companion/skills.lock.json`. A legacy single-`installPath`
record reads as one `claude-code`/`user` target.

Before publishing a brand-new skill, the Skillpack skill must ask the user for both placement
decisions: Personal/My Skills vs Org/everyone, then existing folder, new folder, or no folder. Fetch
the relevant tree first (`GET /personal-labels` for personal, `GET /labels` for org) and validate new
paths as slash-separated, lower-case kebab segments (`[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*`), with no
empty/leading/trailing slash. Labels never affect who can see a skill — they only file it.

For org skills, file a new skill under one or more folders at publish time by repeating a `label`
parameter whose value is a label path (URL-encode the slashes, `%2F`). The folders are created if
they do not exist. Omit `label` to leave the skill unfiled. For personal skills, use the API-supported
personal-folder flow. If publish-time personal labels are not supported by the target server, publish
with `scope=personal`, then immediately file the returned slug with `POST /skills/{slug}/personal-labels`
using the path the user already confirmed.

- `scope` (`personal` | `org`) chooses the library on first create. The Skillpack skill must send it
  explicitly for new skills. Do not send it on re-publish; updates preserve the existing scope.
  Sending legacy `owner_team`, `everyone`, `team`, `teams`, `visibility`, or `private` parameters is
  rejected, and a skill must not declare `scope` or `visibility` in its `SKILL.md`.
- Personal-folder endpoints mirror the org `/labels` set under `/personal-labels` and
  `/skills/{slug}/personal-labels`; they only organize your own authored personal skills.

Examples:

```http
POST /skills?action=publish&expect_slug=my-skill&version=1.0.0&scope=org&label=marketing&label=marketing%2Fseo
Content-Type: application/zip
```

```http
POST /skills?action=publish&expect_slug=my-skill&version=1.0.0&scope=personal
Content-Type: application/zip
```

## Targeted updates

When updating a skill that already exists, send both `expect_slug` and `expect_skill_id`. The server
**requires** both whenever the published slug already exists and rejects the update otherwise
(`updating skill "<name>" requires expect_slug and expect_skill_id`). It also rejects the upload if the
package's frontmatter `name` differs from `expect_slug`. Legacy `metadata.companion_skill_id` is
accepted only as a migration fallback.

On top of that, the server enforces the slug ↔ id binding on **every** publish and validate, even when
no `expect_*` is sent: if the package's `companion.json.metadata.companionSkillId` resolves to a
workspace skill whose slug is not the package name, the upload is rejected
(`package Skillpack skill id "<id>" belongs to skill "<other>", not "<name>"; refusing to retarget`),
and if a skill already exists for the package slug but the package declares a different id, the upload
is rejected (`skill "<name>" has id "<id>", but the package declares Skillpack skill id "<other>";
refusing to retarget`). This makes it impossible for an edit to silently retarget another skill.

## Rename a skill

Use `POST /skills/{slug}/rename` only when the user explicitly wants the same workspace skill id to
move to a new slug. This is not a publish and does not create, archive, duplicate, or replace a skill.

```http
POST /skills/skill-creator/rename
Content-Type: application/json

{ "newSlug": "skill-creator-and-eval", "title": "Skill Creator and Eval" }
```

The response is `{ "ok": true, "id": "...", "old_slug": "skill-creator", "slug":
"skill-creator-and-eval", "title": "Skill Creator and Eval" }`. The `id`, versions, labels,
installs, comments, share token, dependency links, checksums, and package history stay attached
to the same skill. Existing public `/s/{share_token}` links remain valid and resolve to the new slug.
Historical package archives are not rewritten.

After a successful rename, update the local package folder so future publishes use the new slug:
change `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name` and `companion.json.name` to the returned `slug`, keep
`companion.json.metadata.companionSkillId` unchanged, and send future updates with
`expect_slug={newSlug}&expect_skill_id={id}`. Do not try to rename by uploading the old
`companionSkillId` under a new package name; normal `POST /skills` retarget protection will reject it.

A re-publish preserves the skill's existing scope and labels. Do not ask Personal vs Org for updates,
because scope is immutable. Re-publish never moves, adds, or removes folder labels. Ask only whether
to add folders after the update; if yes, publish the new version first, then call
`POST /skills/{slug}/labels` for org skills or `POST /skills/{slug}/personal-labels` for personal
skills using the already-confirmed paths and the library already known from the current workflow. The
registered package download operation does not expose `scope`; if the skill's library is not known, do
not guess or try both routes. Publish the update without folder changes and ask the user to run a
separate organize/folder command from the skill's library context. To remove a skill from a folder,
call the org or personal label routes separately and only after explicit user confirmation.

## Dependencies & archive

Dependencies are un-versioned skill→skill links persisted in a package's `companion.json`
(`{ "dependencies": { "slug-a": "skill-uuid" } }`). Before validate or publish, the Skillpack skill
must still analyze the full local package, compare inferred dependencies with `companion.json`, and
ask before synchronizing additions or removals. Package only after `companion.json` matches the
confirmed dependency map. Repeated `dependency=` parameters are accepted only for old packages without
`companion.json`; do not send them for manifest-backed packages because the manifest is the source of
truth.

`POST /skills?action=validate&dependency=...` returns a `dependency_plan`:

```json
{
  "declared": ["log-parser", "timeline-fmt"],
  "ready": ["log-parser"],
  "upload": [{ "slug": "timeline-fmt", "msg": "declared in the new SKILL.md, not in the registry" }],
  "removed": ["csv-export"],
  "archive_candidates": [{ "slug": "csv-export", "reason": "no published skill requires it anymore" }],
  "blocked": [{ "slug": "self-loop", "status": "cycle", "msg": "self-loop forms a dependency cycle" }]
}
```

A publish whose dependencies are missing or cyclic is rejected with `422` and the same
`dependency_plan` (look at `blocked`). Dependency checks use the normal access model: org skills are
visible to every member, while personal skills are visible only to their creator. Publish dependencies
in `upload` first, in topological order.

`GET /skills/{slug}/dependencies?version=` returns the resolved Requires + Used by graph. Each edge
keeps a live status (`satisfied` / `missing` / `archived` / `cycle`). Dependency reads use the stable
target skill id when the server has one, so a renamed dependency continues to resolve and is shown
under its current slug. `requires[]` contains direct dependencies only. `transitive[]` contains
deduplicated dependencies of dependencies, with `depth` (graph distance from the root skill) and
`via` (the parent slug that pulled the row in). Dependency rows also include `version` (current
published version), `install_status` (`none` / `installed` / `update`), and `installed_version` for
the caller. `install_status: "update"` means the caller's recorded install is behind the current
published dependency closure, matching the Skills list signal. The response counters include
`requires_n`, `transitive_n`, `used_by_n`, and `updates_n`.

Archiving hides a skill from the normal lists but keeps it viewable, restorable, and downloadable
while a published version still references it. `POST /skills/{slug}/archive` accepts an optional
`{ "reason": "…" }`; `POST /skills/{slug}/restore` brings it back. Both require the same permission
as modifying the skill. Only archive a removed dependency after the user confirms, and never when
another published skill still requires it.

## Org labels (folders)

Org labels are the org-wide, **shared** folder tree for org skills. Personal skills use the mirrored
personal folder routes under `/personal-labels` and `/skills/{slug}/personal-labels`. A label is a
slash-separated path of lower-case kebab segments (`marketing/seo`) with an optional human-facing
`displayName` (`SEO`); a skill can carry several, folders may be empty, and labels never change who
can see a skill. Any member can create, assign, rename, recolor, or delete an org label. **The path
always travels in the request body or query, never as a URL path segment**, so the slashes inside a
path survive routing.

`GET /labels` returns `{ "tree": [...], "flat": [...] }`:

```json
{
  "tree": [
    {
      "path": "marketing",
      "name": "marketing",
      "displayName": "Marketing",
      "color": null,
      "icon": null,
      "count": 3,
      "explicit": true,
      "children": [
        { "path": "marketing/seo", "name": "seo", "displayName": "SEO", "color": "oklch(0.72 0.18 145)", "icon": "rocket", "count": 1, "explicit": true, "children": [] }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "flat": [
    { "path": "marketing", "displayName": "Marketing", "color": null, "icon": null },
    { "path": "marketing/seo", "displayName": "SEO", "color": "oklch(0.72 0.18 145)", "icon": "rocket" }
  ]
}
```

`count` is the roll-up of skills at that path or any descendant, de-duplicated per skill. `explicit`
is `true` when a canonical `labels` row exists for the path (an intermediate parent derived only from
a child's path is `explicit: false`). `displayName` is nullable and falls back to the path leaf when
absent. `color` is one of the design swatches or `null`; `icon` is one of the allowed glyph names or
`null`.

Manage the tree (each returns `{ "ok": true }`):

```http
POST /labels            { "path": "marketing/seo", "displayName": "SEO", "color": null, "icon": null }
PUT  /labels/rename     { "from": "marketing", "to": "growth", "displayName": "Growth" }
PUT  /labels/color      { "path": "growth/seo", "color": "oklch(0.72 0.18 145)" }
PUT  /labels/icon       { "path": "growth/seo", "icon": "rocket" }
DELETE /labels          { "path": "growth/seo" }
```

`POST /labels` upserts the path and its ancestors so an empty folder can exist. `rename` and `DELETE`
**cascade** over the path and every descendant (`path = $p OR path LIKE $p/%`) across both the label
set and the skill assignments, in one transaction; `rename` is rejected if `to` collides with an
existing path. Deleting a folder only unfiles its skills — it never deletes a skill.

File a skill into or out of a folder (the skill keeps all its other labels):

```http
POST   /skills/{slug}/labels   { "path": "growth/seo" }
DELETE /skills/{slug}/labels   { "path": "growth/seo" }
```

`POST` upserts the assignment and any missing ancestor folder rows; `DELETE` removes the single
assignment. Both return `{ "ok": true }`. All label routes require any signed-in member or a
`skills:write` token; there is no owner check.

Personal folder routes use the same request bodies and response shapes under `/personal-labels` and
`/skills/{slug}/personal-labels`, but are scoped to the caller and only organize authored personal
skills.

Sidebar ordering is separate from the shared folder tree. Signed-in browser sessions read and replace
`/skill-filter-preferences` as one snapshot:

```json
{
  "active_filters": [],
  "group_by": "folder",
  "sidebar_order": {
    "mine": ["drafts", "research"],
    "org": ["engineering", "marketing", "marketing/seo"]
  }
}
```

Each order array contains canonical label paths in depth-first display order. Empty arrays preserve the
alphabetical default. This is private UI state keyed by the current user and workspace; it never changes
the shared label hierarchy. Personal access tokens cannot call these browser-session preference routes.

## Versions & checksums

Versions are immutable. Each version row carries a `checksum` of the form `sha256:<64 hex>` over the
canonical (uncompressed) tar. This is **not** the hash of the `.zip` the package endpoint serves, so
treat it as a version identity reference, not a byte check of the download. To confirm an install,
check that `SKILL.md` is at the package root and `companion.json.version` matches the version you
fetched.

Before install/update/sync, Skillpack sends the requested root/version to
`POST /secret-retrievals/preflight`; the server resolves its exact dependency closure and bindings.
Required missing slots block before mutation and optional missing slots warn. After one global
confirmation, `install_skill.py --confirm-secrets` creates and redeems the one-time grant, prepares
all packages, and commits packages with private `.env` projections. It never asks for or prints a
value. Legacy flat credentials may still install packages with no secret projection, but a
secret-bearing install requires refreshed schema-v2 credentials with a stable workspace id before
grant creation. Missing, archived, cycle-blocked, not-openable, locally customized, or untracked dependencies
also stop the root install. The bundled Skillpack self-update endpoints remain value-free and do not
use this retrieval flow.

## Local manifest checks

Manifest v2 may declare a local update check:

```json
{
  "checks": {
    "updates": {
      "runtime": "python",
      "script": "scripts/bootstrap.py",
      "timeoutSeconds": 30
    }
  }
}
```

The Skillpack API validates the declaration and verifies the referenced script is packaged, but it
never executes the script. The installed Skillpack skill runs it locally when asked to audit updates.
The bundled `scripts/bootstrap.py` resolves credentials, calls `GET /local-skills/skillpack`,
`GET /skills?lib=mine`, `GET /skills?lib=org`, and `GET /skills?installed=true`, then compares those
rows with `~/.companion/skills.lock.json` or the legacy `skills.log.json` fallback.
`scripts/check_updates.py` remains a compatibility wrapper around the bootstrap.

Run the fast bootstrap when the agent needs startup context:

```sh
python3 scripts/bootstrap.py --json --auto-update-skillpack
```

The JSON shape is stable and contains `workspace`, `companion`, `integrity`, `skills`, `actions`, and
`errors`. With `--auto-update-skillpack`, the script may update only the Skillpack skill itself. It
never installs workspace-published skill updates; it only reports those as actions.

## Local preflight guard

`scripts/skill_guard.py` is a local-only preflight the installed Skillpack skill runs before it
creates, updates, installs, or writes the lockfile for a skill. Like the update check, the API never
runs it.

```sh
python3 scripts/skill_guard.py --json [--create-check <slug>] [skill-dir ...]
```

It unions `GET /skills?lib=org`, `?lib=mine`, `?installed=true`, and the `archived=true` views with the
local inventory (`~/.companion/skills.lock.json` plus scanned local skill folders), reports
duplication / retargeting conflicts, and — when `--create-check` is passed — refuses to create over a
slug that already exists anywhere. If a legacy `~/.companion/skills.log.json` is present it is migrated
into `skills.lock.json` and deleted; secrets are never copied and the token is never printed. Exit code
`0` means clean (warnings allowed), `2` means a blocking conflict or a refused create, `1` means it
could not run.

Scanned local folders include `SKILL.md`-only folders even when `companion.json` is missing. If the
same `SKILL.md` `name` appears in multiple local paths with identical or missing Skillpack ids, the
guard reports a warning kind `duplicate_local_skill_name` with path evidence. Treat that as manual
cleanup guidance only: show the paths to the user, but do not delete or overwrite any local copy
automatically. If the same slug maps to multiple Skillpack ids, it remains a blocking retargeting
conflict.

## Update the Skillpack skill itself

The Skillpack skill must check whether this local Skillpack skill is current at startup, before any
other Skillpack task or skill mutation:

```http
GET /local-skills/skillpack
```

The response includes `status`, `installedVersion`, `availableVersion`, `changes`, and `integrity`.
`integrity.packageChecksum` is the canonical bundled package checksum, and `integrity.files` maps
package-relative paths such as `SKILL.md`, `companion.json`, and `scripts/bootstrap.py` to official
`sha256:<hex>` file hashes. Compare `availableVersion` with the version in the installed Skillpack
skill's `companion.json`. If they match, no update is needed.

If `availableVersion` is newer, download the bundled package:

```http
GET /local-skills/skillpack/package
```

Before replacing anything, compare the installed tracked files with the installed package's
`companion.integrity.json` baseline. If the installed copy predates that baseline and already matches
`availableVersion`, use `integrity.files` from `/local-skills/skillpack` as the fallback baseline. If
any tracked file is modified or missing against the selected baseline, preserve the local folder and
report `reason: "local_customizations"`. If all tracked files match, extract the package into a
temporary directory, verify `SKILL.md` is at the package root, verify its `companion.json.version`
equals the `availableVersion` from `/local-skills/skillpack`, and verify the staged
`companion.integrity.json` matches the staged package files. Only then replace the installed
Skillpack skill folder. After replacement, call `POST /local-skills/skillpack/installed` with the
installed version so the workspace status updates. Delete the transient backup folder created for
this self-update whether or not that install report succeeds. If reporting fails after replacement,
keep the newly installed folder in place, delete the transient backup, and report that confirmation
failed. Any older `companion.backup-*`, `.companion-backup.*`, `*.companion-backup*`, or
`*.backup-*` folder containing `SKILL.md` is stale local state and should be deleted.

Do not use `/skills/{slug}/download` or `/skills/{slug}/versions/{version}/package` to update the
built-in Skillpack skill. Those endpoints are for workspace-published skills.

## Confirm install

```http
POST /local-skills/skillpack/installed
Content-Type: application/json

{ "version": "1.13.0", "agent": "Claude Code" }
```

`version` must be valid semver (use this skill's `companion.json.version`). The response is
`{ "ok": true, "status": "installed" | "update", "availableVersion": "1.13.0" }`.


## Activation reporting (no authentication)

Published `SKILL.md` files include the exact instance URL, skill ID, version, and reporting instructions.
`POST /v1/skill-usage` accepts JSON with `event_id` (fresh UUID per activation), `skill_id` (UUID),
and `version`. Optional `agent`: `claude-code`, `codex`, `opencode`, `pi`, `other`; optional
`environment`: `conductor`, `ci`, `sandbox`, `local`, `other`.

Optional `identity` contains `user_id` and/or `email`, plus `source`: `configured`, `skillpack-local`,
`git-local`, or `git-global`. Use the first available source: `SKILLPACK_TELEMETRY_USER_ID` /
`SKILLPACK_TELEMETRY_EMAIL`, non-secret `~/.skillpack/telemetry.json`, repository Git email, global
Git email. Never obtain reporting metadata from credentials or Git history. Agent/environment may
be configured with `SKILLPACK_TELEMETRY_AGENT` / `SKILLPACK_TELEMETRY_ENVIRONMENT`.

Respect user opt-out and `SKILLPACK_TELEMETRY=0`; use a three-second request timeout, no automatic
retry, and continue on failure. An empty 202 response does not confirm skill existence or acceptance.
Reported identities are unverified; the endpoint never authorizes access to Skillpack data.
The browser Usage tab reads session-authenticated `GET /v1/skills/:slug/usage` with normal scope privacy.
