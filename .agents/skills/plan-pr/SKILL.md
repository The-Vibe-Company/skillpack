description: Turn a prompt, bug report, issue ID, or ticket URL into a
  repository-grounded implementation plan for human approval. Use when the user
  asks to plan a PR, prepare a ticket for implementation, work out how to build
  a feature, or set up the plan-pr workflow. Reads tracker context and repo
  rules, routes to a fixed set of design and TDD skills, and defines observable
  acceptance criteria. After approval the same agent implements, then invokes
  ship-pr-dev. For shipping an existing branch or fixing PR CI without a
  planning request, use ship-pr-dev directly.

# Plan PR

Own preparation of a decision-ready plan. Make the important decisions before implementation, with enough evidence to avoid preventable rework. Keep effort proportional to uncertainty and impact.

## Protected contract

- The user's request and ticket define the outcome. Distinguish requirements, repository facts, and proposed assumptions. Do not quietly replace the need with a preferred solution.
- Planning does not authorize application edits, tracker writes, commits, pushes, or PR creation. Save the plan and requested setup documentation; obtain approval before implementation. Existing explicit approval survives a resume.
- The same agent implements the approved plan. `ship-pr-dev` owns final technical verification, independent code review, scoped corrections, PR creation and CI. Do not duplicate its review board or delivery procedure here.
- Select only from the fixed skill routes below. Do not search a marketplace, install skills, or improvise replacement skill names during a run.
- Read repository instructions and existing validation conventions. Missing optional runtime access is a reported limitation, not an automatic requirement to build a new environment.
- Keep shared configuration portable and task-independent. Credentials stay outside version control; configuration contains references, never secret values.

## 1. Establish context

Resolve the repository, applicable `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, branch state and existing changes. Read `docs/agents/plan-pr.md` and its validation-doc pointer when present. Preserve unrelated work.

Record the actual Git root and distinguish whole-worktree status from a path-limited check. Empty status output does not establish that ignored or untracked input files match a commit. Describe fixtures, exports or other unversioned inputs as inspected snapshots; do not label them a clean checkout without evidence.

If setup is requested, or configuration is absent and the user wants reusable defaults, read `references/setup.md`. Missing setup does not block a one-off plan: infer established repository conventions and record unresolved settings for this run.

For an issue ID or URL, read `references/ticket-intake.md`. An explicit provider URL wins; otherwise use configured tracker mappings. Do not assume every `ABC-123` is Linear. Retrieve the ticket, relevant comments, parent, subtickets and dependencies before freezing scope. When access is incomplete, name what was unavailable and its possible impact. Never claim the entire ticket tree was read from the title alone.

Inspect actual implementation, callers, contracts, tests and CI in the affected area. Look for an existing solution before adding one. For a bug, seek a reproducible symptom or failing test; label an unverified cause as a hypothesis. Use primary documentation when external API/library behavior materially affects a decision.

Ask only consequential questions that cannot be answered from the available evidence. Bundle independent decisions with a recommendation; resolve their prerequisites first. Ordinary reversible implementation choices belong to the agent. A small, precise ticket can need zero questions.

## 2. Route the fixed expertise

Resolve canonical names through the host's available skill catalog and read selected skills before applying them. These are packaged dependencies, conditionally invoked; installing the workflow does not mean loading every skill on every task.

| Trigger | Skill | Phase and expected contribution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consequential product ambiguity remains after research | `grilling` | Planning: frame only the unresolved decision branch; stop when this task is decidable. Do not reopen settled preferences or run a generic interview. |
| New screen, major UI flow or visual direction | `design-frontend-dev` | Planning: choose UX structure, states, responsive behavior and direction; implementation: follow that direction. |
| Existing UI readability, hierarchy or visual polish | `better-ui` | Planning: identify the specific visual problem and acceptance scenarios; implementation: apply focused polish within existing conventions. |
| Motion, transitions or interaction feedback are material | `emil-design-eng` | Planning and implementation: specify interaction behavior, continuity and reduced-motion handling. |
| New or changed testable behavior, including API contracts | `tdd` | Planning: select observable test boundaries and failure cases; implementation: failing test, observed failure, minimal passing code, repeat by vertical slice. |
| Implementation complete, or explicit delivery handoff | `ship-pr-dev` | Delivery: inspect original need and approved plan, validate, review, correct and prepare the PR. |

For every selected skill record its name, availability, invocation phase, narrow assignment and expected result. Repository/user requirements and supplied mockups take precedence over a capability's aesthetic defaults. Multiple UI skills have distinct assignments, not three complete redesigns.

Apply capabilities within this owner's workflow. Reuse decisions already present in the ticket, mockup or conversation instead of repeating a capability's generic intake. In particular, the frontend shaping brief belongs in this plan: its approval also approves that brief, without a separate questionnaire or approval gate. Generate only the preview needed for an unresolved visual decision; do not require a fixed number of design probes when direction is already supplied.

If a selected skill is missing or incompatible, disclose it before approval. Continue independent planning; offer an explicitly limited manual method for optional expertise. Never pretend the skill ran. Missing `ship-pr-dev` prevents the automated shipping handoff, not the creation of a plan. Verify it supports plan input, shared validation instructions and original-requirement review; a matching name alone is insufficient.

## 3. Design the smallest convincing solution

Write observable acceptance criteria before choosing mechanisms. Explain why the proposed change should achieve each outcome. Trace important consumers and failures, not just the edit location. Consider alternatives only when they would change a consequential decision; avoid speculative knobs and abstractions.

For frontend work, inspect current screens when available and follow any supplied mockup. Plan relevant states, realistic data density, viewports and interactions. A new screen or major visual direction without a mockup needs a lightweight preview for approval; keep it outside application code. If preview tooling is unavailable, provide an explicit text/wireframe proposal and its limitation. Small changes to existing UI do not require a new mockup. Treat pixel values not supported by observation as tunable proposals.

For behavior changes, select existing public boundaries and tests worth preserving. The plan's approval also approves those named boundaries for `tdd`; do not ask for the same approval twice. Specify independent expected outcomes, not assertions that mirror implementation. Pure copy/style changes need appropriate inspection, not artificial TDD. A passing geometry test does not prove rendered readability; APIs need functional contract/error tests, frontend needs rendered and interaction evidence when feasible.

Break work into independently verifiable vertical slices. For each, state outcome, likely code area, test/proof and real dependency. Do not prewrite all implementation code or split mechanically into database/API/UI/test phases. Use compatible staged migrations when required by deployment constraints.

## 4. Challenge before presenting

Run a bounded self-review:

1. **Efficacy:** could every step succeed while the original problem remains? Name the missing scenario and fix the plan.
2. **Grounding:** which important claim lacks repository or source evidence? Verify it or label its uncertainty.
3. **Coverage:** does each requirement have an implementation slice and a suitable proof, including material failure paths?
4. **Simplicity:** remove steps, skills and questions that do not improve a decision or outcome.

For high-risk or materially uncertain work, use one fresh read-only reviewer when the host supports it. Give original request, evidence and draft; request concrete omissions and failure scenarios. Correct material findings once and recheck changed concerns. Do not loop to consensus or manufacture a numeric quality score. If independent review is unavailable, label the self-review honestly. This plan review does not replace Ship PR's code review.

## 5. Deliver and obtain approval

Read `references/plan-contract.md` and save `plans/plan-pr/runs/<timestamp>-<topic>/plan.md`, following repo artifact conventions. Write in the user's language. Aim for a screenful for a small change and a short human summary for larger work; link an `evidence.md` only when detail would obscure decisions. Do not create empty ceremonial sections.

Present outcome, approach, meaningful tradeoffs, acceptance evidence, remaining decisions and the plan link. End by requesting approval of this concrete plan. Do not start implementation on silence. Approval does not require optional visual tooling to be available.

## 6. Execute the approved handoff

Record approval with the plan revision and decisions it covers. On resume, reread the plan and inspect repository/source changes; preserve completed steps. Revalidate stale assumptions without asking the user to reapprove unchanged choices.

Implement with the same agent, loading the assigned skills at their specified phases. Record completed slices, test evidence and deviations in the plan's execution notes. Adjust reversible details within the agreed latitude. Pause for a changed outcome, material scope expansion or unresolved consequential conflict.

Finish the plan with this executable instruction, populated with real artifact paths:

> Once implementation is complete, invoke `ship-pr-dev` if available. Pass the original request/ticket context, approved plan and approval, completed work, deviations, acceptance criteria, evidence so far, and the shared validation-document path. Verify both the original need and the approved plan. Include actual changed-screen evidence when available and a concise human testing guide. Honor the user's local-only or no-push constraints. If the dependency is unavailable, state that delivery remains pending and provide this handoff without claiming a PR exists.
